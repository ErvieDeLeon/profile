        Hi! My name is Ervie Marie G. De Leon. I am 20 Years old and I live in Domanpot Asingan, Pangasinan.
        2001 of March 17 is one of the best day in the lives of my parents for that is the day that I was born. I am the seventh 
        child of Mr. Ernesto De Leon (Deceased) and Mrs. Vicky de Leon (Deceased). I love to do many things that I think I inherited from my parents.
        I really love to dance, sing, read, watch movies or Kdrama, playing instruments and discovering/exploring new things. I'm really passionate 
        on what I'm doing to the point that I will give my all, my time, energy, and effort. I use this talents firstly in serving God through it and helping others
        with this. 
      <br>

        Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; 
        in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.<br>
